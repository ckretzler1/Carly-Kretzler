This program displays predicted weather and available hotels in a certain location during a certain time period. It takes user input for the location, start date, and end date that they are searching for, as well as the number of adults theyâ€™re looking to book a hotel for. The program gets weather data for every day in that time period over the last five years and averages it to get predicted high and low temperature and humidity over that time period in that location. The program also uses Selenium to go to the Google hotels page, type in the location, start, date, end date, and number of adults, and scrapes the results.
